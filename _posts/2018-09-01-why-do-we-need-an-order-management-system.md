Before we answer this question let us understand the basics of Ecommerce Systems and Order management System.

## Ecommerce systems

Ecommerce is trading (buying and selling) of goods and services with digital technologies.  Selling might include physical products or services like mobile phone services, subscription services, download of digital products, etc. In simple terms ecommerce is a platform where customer can 
* Buy what they need (products or services or digital products)
* When they need (Shipping speed, or place a future order e.g. subscription order)
* Where they need (Shipped to home or Pickup in Store or ship to personâ€™s home)

## Order management system

OMS is a core backend system responsible for managing end to end order processing. Responsibility of order management system broadly includes managing all aspects of ecommerce, omni-channel, call center functions, inventory, sales, returns, PO, invoice or financial accounting, integrations and so forth. Some examples of Order management system are
* SAP Omnichannel Order Management (Hybris)
* Magento Order Management
* Oracle Order Management
* IBM Sterling Order Management System
* Manhattan Order Management 

## Need for an Order management system

Traditionally companies used ERP systems as core back end systems. As business diversified and with the growth of Omnichannel, integrations to traditional ERP systems became more and more complex. This necessitated the creation of an order management system. Order management System (OMS) would simplify ERP systems functionality by handling complex interactions to and from ecommerce systems, fulfillment systems (typically warehouse management systems), store systems (POS - Point of Sale), Payment Systems, Sales Audit, Fraud Verification, Address verification, etc. In addition to handling complex integrations, OMS system is also responsible for managing inventory, inventory rules, order process flows, determination of best fulfillment center (aka sourcing), returns, purchase order, call center, etc.
